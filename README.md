## Description

The Facebook Marketplace is a platform for buying and selling products on Facebook. This project is an implementation of the system behind the marketplace, which uses AI to recommend the most relevant listings based on a personalised search query.

## Installation

To install the Facebook Marketplace project, you can clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adebayopeter/facebook-marketplaces-recommendation-ranking-system619.git
```
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
```
cd facebook_marketplace
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Create a folder `data` that would serve as our main resource folder.

Inside `data` create a folder `csv` that holds the csv dataset of `Image.csv`, `Prodcts.csv`, `merged_data.csv` and `cleaned_images.csv`. 

Inside the folder, create `images` folder that holds the image dataset and `clean_images` folder where we store the cleaned images.
